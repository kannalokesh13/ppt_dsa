   event streaming platforms (e.g., Apache Pulsar, Amazon Kinesis), or real-time APIs.
   Streaming Data Integration: Set up connectors or adaptors to ingest data from the streaming sources. These connectors should handle the continuous flow of data and ensure 
   data reliability and fault tolerance.

9. Q: What are the challenges involved in integrating data from multiple sources in a data pipeline, and how would you address them?
